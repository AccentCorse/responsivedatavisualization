## Exercises

Exercises are separated per chapter, with each chapter having its own directory, and exercise its own sub-directory.

### Exercise Questions

Exercise questions are repeated in the repo for ease-of-reference as "exercise.md" within each exercise's directory.  The supporting code for each exercise is also in the directory.  File names and types may vary.  Any questions that reference **jQuery** or **D3** do so by referencing the minified version of these libraries in the /assets directory.

### Exercise Answers

Exercises with answers have them within the same directory as the question.

## Resources

Resources referenced within the book can be found in the /resources directory.  These are The Cocktail Guide, and The Train Tracker.
