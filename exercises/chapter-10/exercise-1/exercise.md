You’re going to do a responsive retrofit on a visualization. It’s a listing of a company’s stock price as a series of bar graphs for each day. If you remember from the beginning of this book, that means you’re taking an existing desktop site and using responsive techniques to make it work at least pretty well on smaller screens.

Check out the code from the repository. Try going at it with the following techniques:

Only resize the visualization once. Then, instead of focusing on the D3-created visualization, make the rest of the page responsive.

Now layer in responsive data visualization techniques using the repainting methods you learned in this chapter.
